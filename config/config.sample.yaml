## defines the base name for all output files generated by the Snakemake pipeline
## - for the tutorial, the default is PP_pgPEN_tutorial
## - for data from a pgPEN CRISPR screen, the format is initials_library_cellLine
##   e.g. PP_pgPEN_HeLa
base_filename: pgPEN_tutorial

## input FASTQ file path
## - for the tutorial, input_dir = input/tutorial_fastqs/
## - for sequencing dtaa from a pgPEN CRISPR screen, put your FASTQs into input/fastqs/
##   and set the input_dir variable to input/fastqs/
input_dir: input/tutorial_fastqs/

## number of chunks to split each BAM file into for pgRNA counting step
## - for the tutorial, n_chunks can be 1 (since the FASTQ file is small)
## - for sequencing data from a pgPEN CRISPR screen, try n_chunks: 50
n_chunks: 1
